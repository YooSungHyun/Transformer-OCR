# Transformer-OCR by Torch-Lightning

This Source code is converted https://github.com/him4318/Transformer-ocr to Torch-Lightning

so, core source is same that git repo!



Before use, chk your gpu count and change some scripts plz!!!!!!

I didn't final launch test after clean code, so some code error can be occurred



this source not need vocab.json, because `models/transformer_ocr/tokenizer.py` in it

but I write `make_vocab.py` when if you needðŸ¤—
